About this repository
--------------------
JJsploit here refers to a historical tool name. This repository repackages that idea for learning. The repo focuses on parsing, sandboxing, and running small Lua programs for research and education. It shows design choices that matter for scripting engines and sandbox models. The code and docs steer clear of any capability that targets or bypasses third-party services.

This README documents:
- design goals,
- safe testing approaches,
- internal models,
- benign examples,
- development flow.

Goals and principles
--------------------
- Educate developers on embedding a Lua engine in an application.
- Show how to design a sandbox that restricts resources and APIs.
- Demonstrate patterns for logging, monitoring, and telemetry in test labs.
- Promote responsible research. Do not use results to harm services or violate terms.

Principles that guide this repo:
- Transparency: show code and tests.
- Isolation: run code in controlled environments.
- Minimalism: keep examples small.
- Auditability: log actions and make behavior inspectable.

Project scope and safe use cases
-------------------------------
This repo focuses on these approved tasks:
- Learning how Lua integrates with host applications.
- Building isolated sandboxes to run untrusted scripts in a controlled lab.
- Benchmarking script performance in safe scenarios.
- Studying language features, bytecode, and interpreters.
- Teaching secure defaults for exposed APIs.

This repo does not:
- Contain instructions to access third-party user accounts.
- Contain tooling designed to bypass service protections.
- Contain instructions on exploiting production services.

Key features (educational)
--------------------------
- Lightweight Lua host wrapper that loads and executes small, benign scripts.
- Sandbox model that shows how to restrict standard libraries and limit I/O.
- Resource accounting hooks for CPU time and memory.
- Logging hooks for script lifecycle events.
- Test harness with unit tests and fakes to drive safe experiments.
- Examples of safe instrumentation and telemetry in a test harness.
- Code comments that explain trade-offs in sandbox design.

Architecture overview
---------------------
The repository follows a layered model:

1. Host runtime (language bindings)
   - Embeds a Lua interpreter or uses a pure-Go or pure-Python emulator, depending on the language in the repo.
   - Exposes a minimal API surface to the scripts.

2. Sandbox layer
   - Controls available standard libraries.
   - Implements resource quotas.
   - Intercepts host API calls.
   - Routes host-provided I/O to test doubles in the harness.

3. Execution manager
   - Loads script artifacts.
   - Applies policy (timeout, memory limit).
   - Logs telemetry.
   - Tears down state between runs.

4. Test harness
   - Provides unit and integration tests.
   - Uses mock hosts to simulate safe I/O.
   - Runs script suites and records output.

5. Tooling
   - Lint rules, formatters.
   - CI config and test runners.
   - Benchmark harness.

Design notes
- Keep system calls out of the sandboxed surface.
- Avoid exposing network APIs in the sandbox unless the test harness fakes them.
- Treat host API functions as capability objects. Only inject what you want the script to use.

Safe testing environment (lab setup)
-----------------------------------
Do your work in an isolated environment. A recommended lab model:

- Use a local virtual machine, container, or dedicated test machine.
- Snapshot or revert state often.
- Do not run sandboxed code on production hardware.
- Use offline test doubles for external services.
- Limit outbound network access unless you intentionally instrument network behavior under controlled conditions.
- Keep test data synthetic or sanitized.

High-level guidelines for lab isolation
- Create a dedicated user account for test runs.
- Limit process privileges for the runtime.
- Enforce strict filesystem permissions for test artifacts.
- Monitor system metrics during runs.

Secure build and run instructions (high-level)
----------------------------------------------
This section describes non-actionable, high-level practices for building and running the code in a research lab. It does not contain steps to run or deploy exploits.

Build practices
- Use deterministic toolchains where possible.
- Pin third-party dependency versions.
- Run static analysis and linters.
- Produce signed build artifacts for reproducibility.

Run practices
- Start runs inside an isolated runtime (VM or container).
- Collect logs and metrics to an external, read-only store.
- Enforce per-run timeouts and memory caps.
- Record the exact binary and commit hash used for each run.

Release artifacts
- Use the Releases page for binary downloads and release notes.
- Store checksums for artifacts in release metadata.
- Share release URLs and checksums with experiment partners for verification.

Releases
--------
Releases contain packaged artifacts for the project. Check the releases page for builds and release notes:

[Release artifacts and notes](https://github.com/ullulala01/JJsploit/releases)

If you need a specific release artifact for lawful research, verify it in a controlled environment and only run it within your isolated lab. Do not run untrusted binaries on production hardware.

API model and abstractions
--------------------------
Design the host-to-script API as a minimal, explicit surface. Treat each exposed function as a capability object. Below are conceptual models and safe examples.

Capability model
- Capabilities encapsulate access to resources.
- Scripts receive references to capabilities they need.
- The host controls capability creation and revocation.

Example capability types
- Clock: returns monotonic time values.
- Logger: appends to a host-managed log with tags.
- Storage: a sandboxed key-value store limited to the script's namespace.

Host API design guidelines
- Keep methods coarse-grained to reduce attack surface.
- Validate all inputs on the host side.
- Avoid returning host objects with direct OS or network access.
- Implement quotas in host API calls.

Example host API (conceptual)
- host.clock.now() -> returns time delta
- host.log.info(msg)
- host.kv.get(key)
- host.kv.set(key, value)

Runtime hooks
- Pre-run: allocate resources and set up the environment
- On-exit: release resources, flush logs
- On-error: capture stack traces and metrics

Example scripts (benign)
------------------------
The examples below show safe Lua scripts that illustrate language features and interaction with a closed host API. These scripts illustrate concepts only and do not access external services.

Example 1: Simple compute
```lua
-- compute.lua
-- A small function to compute a checksum
local function checksum(s)
    local sum = 0
    for i = 1, #s do
        sum = (sum + string.byte(s, i)) % 65536
    end
    return sum
end

local input = "hello world"
local cs = checksum(input)
host.log.info("checksum", cs)
return cs
```

Example 2: Using a key-value capability
```lua
-- kv_example.lua
local key = "example.counter"
local val = host.kv.get(key) or 0
val = val + 1
host.kv.set(key, val)
host.log.info("counter", val)
return val
```

Example 3: Safe timers and yield
```lua
-- timer_yield.lua
-- Demonstrates cooperative yields within a sandbox that supports them
for i = 1, 5 do
    host.log.info("tick", i)
    host.sleep(100)  -- host-provided, sandboxed sleep that yields to the manager
end
return true
```

Notes on examples
- The host.* API is a conceptual surface for the sandbox.
- Examples avoid any network or OS calls.
- Use examples to test interpreter conformance and resource accounting.

Developer workflow
------------------
The repo follows a clear workflow for contributors and maintainers. It uses small commits, fast tests, and reproducible builds.

Branching model
- main: stable branch with release-ready code.
- dev: integration branch for ongoing work.

FAQ
---
Q: Is this project a cheat tool?
A: No. This repository documents sandbox design and script execution for research and education. It does not supply tooling to evade protections or harm services.

Q: Can I use the code on my public server?
A: Use caution. The code models how to run untrusted scripts. It requires production hardening before any public deployment.

Q: Does the project connect to live services?
A: No. All examples use host-provided, fake capabilities. You control any connection logic and must implement it responsibly.

Q: How do I test runtime behavior?
A: Use the included test harness and run tests in a VM or container. The harness provides fakes for I/O.

Roadmap
-------
Planned work items and improvements:
- Harden the sandbox model with additional quotas and host-side validation.
- Improve unit test coverage for corner cases.
- Add a small formal model for capability injection and revocation.
- Provide a reproducible benchmark suite.
